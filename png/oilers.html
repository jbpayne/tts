      The Oilers would have their best season in 2014â€“15 and won the EHL playoffs
      and league championship. Winning the league championship would normally
      qualify the team for the 2015 USA Hockey Tier III National Championships,
      however due to a clerical error with a pair of the Oilers' import player's
      paperwork, the runner-up Northern Cyclones represented the EHL. Due to these
      circumstances, the EHL would later void their playoff championship and claim
      a "vacant" playoff champion for that season.
